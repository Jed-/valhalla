## About
We are a team of volunteers that have been collaborating since 2019 and are brought together by our shared enthusiasm and creativity.
In an effort to enhance our skills and learn new things, we are working to bring the project's shared goal to life.

Although Valhalla is inspired by [Cube 2: Sauerbraten](http://sauerbraten.org) and numerous other ancient video games, it does not intend to blindly follow the path of other similar projects and attempt to create yet another *clone* of well-known old-school games, but rather it seeks to innovate the genre by proposing a simple but enjoyable shooter, experimenting with fresh concepts and combining old-school and modern elements to create something distinctive, leading to a modern interpretation of the classic arena gameplay.

We strive to offer the majority of players a satisfying gaming experience by making sure Valhalla is always free and open source, collaborating with the community, focusing on the creation of a nice blend of classic and casual gameplay and trying to enhance the built-in map editor based on the Cube Engine 2.

Anyone can contribute features, assets and ideas to the project to help it develop.

## Goals
Some of the goals we have in mind are:
- **Accessibility**: Add tutorials and other important features to help new players get into the game.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Support Windows, Mac, and Linux.
- **Depth**: Create simple yet convincing lore to give the game a sense of purpose and its universe a story with depth.
- **Game Engine**: Tweak, maintain, and update the engine together with the community.
- **Immersion**: Bring audio, effects, and gunplay closer to modern standards.
- **Iterate on the Arena Shooter Formula**: Experiment with new ideas and enhance the arena shooter experience.
- **Map Editor Improvements**: Make most features of the map editor accessible through a simple and clear user interface.
- **Simplicity**: Build gameplay that is interesting and varied while keeping the game itself simple, polished, and fun.
- **UI/HUD Improvements and Customization**: Make the UI clear and accessible while allowing easy customization.
- **Unique Aesthetics**: Maintain an art direction that helps create something distinct and original.
- **Vibrant Atmosphere**: Avoid hyper-realistic and gloomy design language, build levels that feel open and bright.
