# Valhalla project
*A first-person arena shooter project based on [Tesseract](tesseract.gg) which focuses on both classic and casual gameplay.*

## About
The project started in march 2019.
We are a bunch of hobbyists and enthusiasts held together by a common passion and creativity, who are working together to achieve a unified vision for the project, hoping to improve in our capabilities and learn something in the process.

Valhalla aims to always be *free* and *open source*. We try to deliver a good game experience by focusing on classic and casual gameplay and collaborating with the community. Anyone can help and contribute ideas or content to make the project grow.

## Goals

*Valhalla tries to innovate the arena genre: create a simple yet fun shooter, while experimenting with original ideas and mixing old school and modern elements together.*

- adding tutorials and other important features that help new players get into the game;
- being open to tweak and maintain the engine, develop features with the community;
- colourful graphics: avoid hyper-realistic and gloomy stuff, we do not need ANOTHER gritty sci-fi shooter;
- focus on classic modes as well as on casual modes (like Infection) so newbies and casuals can have fun too;
- immersion: decent audio, decent effects, decent gunplay. Try to catch up a bit with today's standards;
- improve the built-in editor: simplify its appearence, more features accessible through clear user interface;
- smooth movement system: not too boring, not too complex;
- the gameplay wants to be interesting and various, but also simple, polished and fun;
- Windows, Mac and Linux support;
