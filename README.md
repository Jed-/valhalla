# Valhalla project
An arena shooter project based on Tesseract which focuses on both competitive and casual gameplay.

I've put together a list of things I would like to do with this project.
If you think you can help with these feel free to join the project!

Please note: anything written below is not set in stone, everything is open to discussion, suggestions and ideas.

## General

the aim is to create a well-balanced arena-style shooter with casual, fun modes such as Infection, Gunball (football/rugby mode), Invasion (online Sauerbraten DMSP), boss mode and other cool stuff!

- create a gameplay which is more complex, interesting and various than Sauerbraten's gameplay but in the same time as simple, polished and fun as possible;

- create a not too complicated yet interesting movement system, add mutators and other variables to make every game even more unique;

- try to revolutionate the arena fps genre with new ideas;

- colorful graphics (if not a little bit cartoony): spooky maps are welcome from time to time but let's avoid too much hyper realistic (since the gameplay is unrealistic) or gloomy stuff, we don't need ANOTHER gritty sci-fi shooter;

- create competitive modes aswell as casual modes, like zombie mode and invasion mode (online Sauerbraten DMSP) to let newbies and casual players have fun with their friends, too;

- add a progression system and features that allow the players to customize their player model;

- improve the editor: simplify the editor's appearence, make more functions accessible trough clear user interface;

- supporting and encouraging new players as much as possible with matchmaking and other important features which could help new players get into the game;

- keep the game as light as possible;

- create a game launcher and add an updater in it to let players know when their game version is outdated;

- tweak the engine, add features players want to see and develope them with the community.


Some of these points are further explained in the lists below.

## User interface

Improve the general user interface: make it as clear as possible, noob-friendly.

- letting the player know when there has been a connection problem or when they got kicked with a clear UI window;

- improve server browser: server previews, letting the joining player type the server passwords directly in the browser;

- launcher that allows players to edit server variables and set up their own server;

- move frag messages regarding the player (you got killed by, you killed, double kill, etc) to the center of the screen;

- move the frag messages regarding other players (dude killed dude) from the regular console to the right top of the screen;

- move CTF and other important mode-specific messages to the center of the screen;

- an alternative scoreboard (toggable by pressing F2) which shows more player statistics than the regular scoreboard like damage dealt, accuracy, medals (double kill, killing sprees), etc;

- player model 3D preview on the left (or right) side in the main menu;

## Server

- vote kick, allows players to kick a hacker or another abusive player when a master isn't there, and possibly a system that doesn't let players abuse it (example: one player can start only one vote kick per match);

- ability for developers to send global messages (visible to any player in any server in the master server);

- the game recognizes modded servers and let players know they are modified before joining;

## Gameplay

trying to revolutionate the arena fps genre: big NO to the fear of creating and experimenting particular and original weapons, attack combinations and modes (as long as they're not too complicated); adding classic FFA mode (which relies heavily on map control and is not that noob-friendly) as a mutator; suggestions are welcome!

- create a not too complex yet interesting movement system: adding, for example, wall jump and dodge as mutators is more than enough;

- new casual modes: race mode, invasion mode (online Sauerbraten DMSP), football mode (Gunball), side scroller mode (Side Scroller Deathmatch/SSD), online boss mode;

- EXP point gains to level up after every match (online multiplayer only) for players who have an account (?);

- game point gains to unlock player skins and vanity items after every match (online multiplayer only) for players who have an account (?);

- integrated player statistics, ranking, achievements, progression system with various and unlockable vanity items, skins, etc. (nothing gameplay changing)(?);

- improve bots' AI (especially movement);

- movement and weapons tutorials for newcomers;

## Aesthetics

- cartoonish and/or colourful graphics, without exaggerating... avoid the grittiness/darkness of Quake and of most maps in Sauerbraten;

- unique characters (player models) with unique personalities and voices;

- immersive atmopshere (ambient sounds, decent audio and graphics/effects, cool weapons effects to make sure that weapons are fun to shoot and feel powerful);

- player model customization: variables that allow players to attach cosmetic items, change texture colors and customize their player model further;

## Editor & engine

- being open to tweak the engine and add features;

- possibility to download a new map in-game everytime it's available on the server, even outside edit mode (with custom files like textures and sounds?);

- possibility to undo or redo modifications done by our client in online coop edit;

- mini in-game Quadropolis that allows players to share maps, mods and stuff (?);
