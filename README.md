## About
We are a team of volunteers that have been collaborating since 2019 and are brought together by our shared enthusiasm and creativity.
In an effort to enhance our skills and learn new things, we are working to bring the project's shared goal to life.

Although Valhalla is inspired by [Cube 2: Sauerbraten](http://sauerbraten.org) and numerous other ancient video games, it does not intend to blindly follow the path of other similar projects and attempt to create yet another *clone* of well-known old-school games, but rather it seeks to innovate the genre by proposing a simple but enjoyable shooter, experimenting with fresh concepts and combining old-school and modern elements to create something distinctive, leading to a modern interpretation of the classic arena gameplay. 

We strive to offer the majority of players a satisfying gaming experience by making sure Valhalla is always free and open source, collaborating with the community, focusing on the creation of a nice blend of classic and casual gameplay and trying to enhance the built-in map editor based on the Cube Engine 2.

Anyone can contribute features, assets and ideas to the project to help it develop.

## Goals
Some of the goals we have in mind are: 
- **accessibility**: add tutorials and other important features that help new players get into the game;
- **map editor improvements**: simplify its appearance, more features accessible through clear user interface;
- **colourful graphics**: avoid hyper-realistic and gloomy stuff, we do not need *another* gritty sci-fi shooter;
- **cross-platform**: support for Windows, Mac and Linux;
- **depth**: create a simple yet convincing lore that does not limit our creativity in order to give the game's universe depth and plausibility; 
- **immersion**: decent audio, decent effects, decent gunplay. Try to catch up a bit with today's standards;
- **iterate on the arena shooter formula**: pick up where the genre left off, experiment with new things, and enhance the user experience;
- **maintenance**: tweak and maintain the engine, develop features with the community;
- **simplicity**: gameplay aims to be interesting and various but also simple, polished and fun;
- **UI/HUD improvements and customization**: we plan to make a clear and accessible UI that is scriptable and easily customizable;
- **unique aesthetics**: the art direction, which tries to create something distinct and original, is given significant weight;
