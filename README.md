# Valhalla project
An arena shooter project based on Tesseract which focuses on both competitive and casual gameplay.

I have put together a list of things I would like to do with this project.
Please note: anything written below is not set in stone, everything is open to discussion, suggestions and ideas.

## Summary

*The aim is to innovate the arena genre, create a simple yet fun shooter with classic, casual and fun modes such as Infection, Gunball (football/rugby mode), Invasion (online Sauerbraten DMSP) and other cool stuff!*

- create a gameplay which is more complex, interesting and various than Sauerbraten's gameplay but in the same time as simple, polished and fun as possible;

- smooth movement system: not too boring, not too complex;

- try to innovate the arena genre;

- colorful graphics: let's avoid too much hyper realistic or gloomy stuff, we don't need ANOTHER gritty sci-fi shooter;

- focus on classic modes as well as on casual modes (like Infection mode) so newbies and casuals can have fun too;

- add a progression system and features that allow the players to customize their player model (?);

- improve the editor: simplify the editor's appearence, make more functions accessible trough clear user interface;

- supporting and encouraging new players as much as possible with matchmaking and other important features which could help new players get into the game;

- keep the game as light as possible;

- create a game launcher and add an updater in it to let players know when their game version is outdated;

- tweak the engine, add features players want to see and develop them with the community. Though the goal is not to make a new engine, but a new game.


Some of these points are further explained in the lists below.

## User interface

*Improve the general user interface: make it as clear as possible, noob-friendly.*

- letting the player know when there has been a connection problem or when they got kicked with a clear UI window;

- improve server browser: server previews, letting the joining player type the server passwords directly in the browser;

- launcher that allows players to edit server variables and set up their own server;

- move frag messages regarding the player (you got killed by, you killed, double kill, etc) to the center of the screen;

- move CTF and other important mode-specific messages to the center of the screen;

- kill feed;

- player model 3D preview on the left (or right) side in the main menu.

## Server

- vote kick, allows players to kick a hacker or another abusive player when a master isn't there, and possibly a system that doesn't let players abuse it (example: one player can start only one vote kick per match);

- ability for developers to send global messages (visible to any player in any server in the master server);

- the game recognizes modded servers and let players know they are modified before joining.

## Gameplay

*Trying to innovate the arena genre: experimenting with particular and original weapons/mechanics and modes (without over-complicating things);*

- keep classic modes that heavily rely on map control (not that noob-friendly) as mutators;

- smooth movement system: not too boring, not too complex;

- new casual modes: race mode, invasion mode (online Sauerbraten DMSP), football mode (Gunball), side scroller mode (Side Scroller Deathmatch/SSD), etc. ;

- EXP point gains to level up after every match (online multiplayer only) for players who have an account (?);

- integrated player statistics, ranking, achievements, progression system with various and unlockable vanity items, skins, etc. (nothing gameplay changing)(?);

- improve bots;

- movement and weapons tutorials for newcomers;

## Aesthetics

- colourful graphics, avoid the grittiness/darkness of Quake and of most maps in Sauerbraten;

- unique characters (player models) with unique personalities and voices;

- immersive atmopshere (decent audio, decent effects, decent gunplay to make sure weapons are fun to shoot and feel powerful);

- player model customization: variables that allow players to attach cosmetic items, change texture colors and customize their player model further;

## Editor & engine

- being open to tweak the engine and add features. Though the goal is to create a new game, not a new engine;

- possibility to download a new map in-game everytime it's available on the server, even outside edit mode (with custom files like textures and sounds?);

- mini in-game Quadropolis that allows players to share maps, mods and stuff (?);
