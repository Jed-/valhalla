# Valhalla project
*A first-person arena shooter project based on [Tesseract](http://tesseract.gg) which focuses on both classic and casual gameplay.*

## About
The project started in march 2019.
We are a bunch of hobbyists and enthusiasts held together by a common passion and creativity, who are working together to achieve a unified vision for the project, hoping to improve in our capabilities and learn something in the process.

Valhalla aims to always be *free* and *open source*. We try to deliver a good game experience for everyone by focusing on classic, old school and casual gameplay and collaborating with the community. Anyone can help and contribute ideas or content to make the project grow.

## Goals

*Valhalla tries to innovate the arena genre: create a simple yet fun shooter, while experimenting with original ideas and mixing old school and modern elements together.*

Some of the things we plan to accomplish:
- accessibility: add tutorials and other important features that help new players get into the game;
- built-in map editor improvements: simplify its appearence, more features accessible through clear user interface;
- colourful graphics: avoid hyper-realistic and gloomy stuff, we do not need *another* gritty sci-fi shooter;
- cross-platform: support for Windows, Mac and Linux;
- iterate on the arena shooter formula. Take up from where the genre left off, experiment, improve user's experience;
- immersion: decent audio, decent effects, decent gunplay. Try to catch up a bit with today's standards;
- maintenance: tweak and maintain the engine, develop features with the community;
- simplicity: gameplay aims to be interesting and various but also simple, polished and fun;
- uniqueness: much importance is given to the art direction, which aims to create something unique and distinct.
